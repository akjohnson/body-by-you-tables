Body By You Tables
==================

These tables are meant to be used in conjuction with the
[Body By You](http://www.amazon.com/Body-You-Guide-Womens-Fitness/dp/0345528972)
exercise program.  You will still need the book to use them, but by using these you can avoid
making marks in the book.

These tables are slightly different than the ones in the books; they contain a dedicated upgrade
column.

Printing
--------

The best way to print out each table set it is to open it up in Chrome.  They look better
printed out in Landscape without any headers or footers.  They print out one table
per page.
