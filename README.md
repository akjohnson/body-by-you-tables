Body By You Tables
==================

These tables are meant to be used in conjuction with the
[Body By You](http://www.amazon.com/Body-You-Guide-Womens-Fitness/dp/0345528972)
exercise program from the You Are Your Own Gym (YAYOG) franchise.  You will still
need the book to use them, but by using these you can avoid making marks in the book
or have a separate table for different people in your household.

These tables are slightly different than the ones in the books; they contain a dedicated upgrade
column.

Printing
--------

The best way to print out each table set it is to open it up in Chrome.  They look better
printed out in Landscape without any headers or footers.  They print out one table
per page.
